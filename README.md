# Space-Shooter
Project 2 for MSCH-C220

Arcade space shooter

## Implementation
This game was written in GDScript with Godot.

## What Makes this a Game?
This is a game because it allows a player to operate in a world in which their actions determine a significant outcome on the world. A player can play many times, getting better at the mechanics to reach higher scores, watch their actions impact the world around them by attacking obstacles and dodging enemy bullets, and feel accomplishment at their effort to protect this imaginary galaxy by helping their cute little spaceship fight its adversaries.
